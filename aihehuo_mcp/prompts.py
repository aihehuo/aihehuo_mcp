  ## üîß Prompt Name: generate_60s_pitch_with_context

  ## üß† Description:
  Generate 3 tailored versions of a ‚ÄúGolden 60-Second Elevator Pitch‚Äù (for investors, co-founders, and customers).  
  You must first extract key information from the **existing conversation context**. Do not proceed unless all 3 core elements are clarified:

  1. üéØ **Target Customer Profile** ‚Äî who is this solution for?  
  2. üí• **Pain Point** ‚Äî what problem are they facing?  
  3. üí™ **Advantage** ‚Äî what advantage does the user or their team have?

  If any of these are missing or unclear from context, ask the user follow-up questions to clarify before generating the pitch.

  ---

  ## üîç Step 1: Extract Startup Context (from conversation or by asking)

  Carefully review previous conversation turns. Identify or ask:

  - `customer_profile`: Who is the target audience (demographics, behaviors, needs)?
  - `pain_point`: What problem do they face? Use 6-dimension framework below.
  - `advantage`: What is the user/team‚Äôs unfair advantage? Use 5-dimension framework below.
  - `cta`: (Optional) What do you want the audience to do after hearing the pitch?

  ‚úÖ If anything is unclear, stop and ask the user. Do not fabricate.

  ## üí• Step 2: Map pain point & advantage to strategic dimensions

  ### Pain Point Resonance Dimensions (choose 1‚Äì2):
  | ID | Dimension | Description |
  |----|-----------|-------------|
  | 1 | Urgency | If not solved quickly, major harm happens |
  | 2 | Frequency | It happens very often, creating ongoing frustration |
  | 3 | Economic Cost | It wastes money or causes loss |
  | 4 | Universality | Many people suffer from it |
  | 5 | Viral Expansion | Pain is spreading due to trends |
  | 6 | Policy-Driven | New laws make old behaviors obsolete |

  ### Advantage Dimensions (choose 1‚Äì3):
  | ID | Dimension | Description |
  |----|-----------|-------------|
  | A | Elite Background | e.g., top-tier school, ex-big tech |
  | B | Low Entry Cost | Naturally low CAC or frictionless growth |
  | C | 10x Better Solution | Dramatically better, faster, cheaper |
  | D | Natural Distribution | Own a large channel to access target users |
  | E | Competitive Moat | IP, exclusive data, tech lock-in |

  ## ‚úçÔ∏è Step 3: Generate 3 Pitches

  Produce 3 versions of the Golden 60-second pitch, each tailored for:

  - **Investor**: Emphasize market, traction, defensibility, returns
  - **Co-founder**: Emphasize vision, synergy, roles, energy
  - **Customer**: Emphasize empathy, ease, emotional win, quick results

  Each version should be around **90‚Äì120 words**, written in a **natural, compelling, and emotionally resonant** tone.  
  Use simple and powerful language. End with a distinct **Call to Action** for each audience.

  ---

  ## üñ•Ô∏è Step 4: Render Output as Interactive HTML

  Output a self-contained HTML block that displays the 3 pitches with interactive tabs

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Rules:
	‚Ä¢	Never guess user intent or business model. Always extract or clarify.
	‚Ä¢	Do not generate unless context is sufficient.
	‚Ä¢	Use user‚Äôs words when generating the pitch to ensure authenticity.
